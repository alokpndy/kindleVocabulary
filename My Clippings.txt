have to say that I plucked quite a few words out of the original stories to act as guideposts, to give the text a sense of authenticity. My favourites are: ‘snibbed’, ‘foeman’, ‘sickish’ (used by Lestrade) and ‘passementerie’. That said, the book is actually being written in around 1916 and I would imagine that by this time Watson’s own language and writing style would have become more modern.

If the user has entered a website address that is truncated but your website receives enough information to identify the page he’s looking for, simply forward him to that page. If your application tries to connect to a server but the connection times out, make the application try again before telling the user there’s something wrong.

The Indus, to which most of these seven rivers were tributary, was the sindhu par excellence ; and in the language of ancient Persian, a near relative of Sanskrit, the initial ‘s’ of a Sanskrit word was invariably rendered as an aspirate – ‘h’. Soma, the mysterious hallucinogen distilled, deified and drunk to excess by the Vedic arya, is thus homa or haoma in old Persian; and sindhu is thus Hind[h]u. When, from Persian, the word found its way into Greek, the initial aspirate was dropped, and it started to appear as the route ‘Ind’ (as in ‘India’, ‘Indus’, etc.).

If I could talk, I could ask others, “What year is it? What day? What number?” But what would be the point of that? What would that number tell me? Anyway, time is more than counting days. On the outside, people think clocks tell them the time. They set an alarm for work and wake up to a blinking light that says six a.m. They look to an office wall to tell them if it is time to go home. The truth is, clocks don’t tell time. Time is measured in meaning.

Even by merely shifting them a bit, we can make it look as if there were four pairs of dots, rather than eight individual dots. This is called proximity, as mentioned earlier. Here’s another way of grouping the dots into pairs: changing the colors of four of the dots again turns the dots into four pairs of similarly colored dots. We can also change the size of the dots to achieve the same effect. Or we can change the orientation. These three examples show groupings based on color, size, and orientation. But these aren’t the only similarities you can use to group things. Different font styles, for example, might be another way of achieving this.

For example, instead of making class Window a subclass of Rectangle (because windows happen to be rectangular), the Window class might reuse the behavior of Rectangle by keeping a Rectangle instance variable and delegating
==========

In other words, instead of a Window being a Rectangle, it would have a Rectangle. Window must now forward requests to its Rectangle instance explicitly, whereas before it would have inherited those operations. The following diagram depicts the Window class delegating its Area operation to a Rectangle instance. A plain arrowhead line indicates that a class keeps a reference to an instance of another class. The reference has an optional name, "rectangle" in this case. The main advantage of delegation is that it makes it easy to compose behaviors at run-time and to change the way they're composed. Our window can become circular at run-time simply by replacing its Rectangle instance with a Circle instance, assuming Rectangle and Circle have the same type. Delegation has a disadvantage it shares with other techniques that make software more flexible through object composition: Dynamic, highly parameterized software is harder to understand than more static software. There are also run-time inefficiencies, but the human inefficiencies are more important in the long run. Delegation is a good design choice only when it simplifies more than it complicates. It isn't easy to give rules that tell you exactly when to use delegation, because how effective it will be depends on the context and on how much experience you 33

wanted to.... Her slow, enchanting smile, her long lustrous black hair, her slender feet, all remain fresh in my memory. A magical day, a magical year. And today, some forty years later, I cannot help feeling that if I go down to that stream again, I will find our footprints embedded in the sand. Another clear memory is of my first visit to the hill-station—not just forty years ago, when I came to settle here, but sixty-five years ago.... A small boy of seven, I was placed in a convent school, where I was very unhappy. But my father came to see me during the summer break, and kept me with him in a boarding-house on the Mall. Always the best of companions, he took me to the pictures and for long pony and rickshaw-rides. A little cinema below Hakman's was my favourite. Hakman's was a great place then, with a band and a dance-hall and a posh restaurant. Nearby there was a skating-rink, which was consumed by a fire in the 1960s. We had no fire-engine then. We have one now, but when Victor Banerjee's house caught fire a few years ago, the fire-engine could not negotiate the narrow Landour bazaar, and by the time it arrived the house had burnt down. Victor was very philosophical about the whole thing, and went about re-building his dream house which is a great improvement on the old one. At seventy-one (my age, not Victor's), it is time to look forward, not backward, and one should not dwell too much on the past but prepare oneself to make the most of whatever time is left to us on this fascinating planet. That is why I called my Foreword a Backward, and this epilogue a Forward—for forward we must march, whatever our age or declining physical prowess.

Graphical notations, while important and useful, aren't sufficient. They simply capture the end product of the design process as relationships between classes and objects. To reuse the design, we must also record the decisions, alternatives, and trade-offs that led to it. Concrete examples are important too, because they help you see the design in action. We describe design patterns using a consistent format. Each pattern is divided into sections according to the following template. The template lends a uniform structure to the information, making design patterns easier to learn, compare, and use. Pattern Name and Classification

The desolate, deserted trees, The faded earth, the heavy sky, The beauties she so truly sees, She thinks I have no eye for these, And vexes me for reason why.   Not yesterday I learned to know The love of bare November days Before the coming of the snow, But it were vain to tell her so, And they are better for her praise.

The Buried Giant (Kazuo Ishiguro)

You would have searched a long time for the sort of winding lane or tranquil meadow for which England later became celebrated. There were instead miles of desolate, uncultivated land; here and there rough-hewn paths over craggy hills or bleak moorland. Most of the roads left by the Romans would by then have become broken or overgrown, often fading into wilderness. Icy fogs hung over rivers and marshes, serving all too well the ogres that were then still native to this land. The people who lived nearby—one wonders what desperation led them to settle in such gloomy spots—might well have feared these

In one such area on the edge of a vast bog, in the shadow of some jagged hills, lived an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice. Perhaps these were not their exact or full names, but for ease, this is how we will refer to them. I would say this couple lived an isolated life, but in those days few were “isolated” in any sense we would understand. For warmth and protection, the villagers lived in shelters, many of them dug deep into the hillside, connecting one to the other by underground passages and covered corridors. Our elderly couple lived within one such sprawling warren—

Robin Ellacott was twenty-six years old and had been engaged for over a year. Her wedding ought to have taken place three months previously, but the unexpected death of her future mother-in-law had led to the ceremony’s postponement. Much had happened during the three months since the wedding should have happened. Would she and Matthew have been getting on better if vows had been exchanged, she wondered. Would they be arguing less if a golden band was sitting beneath the sapphire engagement ring that had become a little loose on her finger?

Whatever Mum’s saying’s drowned out by the grimy roar of the bus pulling away, revealing a pub called The Fox and Hounds. The sign shows three beagles cornering a fox. They’re about to pounce and rip it apart. A street sign underneath says WESTWOOD ROAD. Mum said that lords and ladies are rich, so I was expecting swimming pools and Lamborghinis, but Westwood Road looks pretty normal to me. Normal brick houses, detached or semi-detached, with little front gardens and normal cars.

I’m a novelist by nature, I will grant you that, and I have a particular liking for the long ones that create an immersive experience for writer and reader, where the fiction has a chance to become a world that’s almost real. When a long book succeeds, the writer and reader are not just having an affair; they are married. When

But there’s something to be said for a shorter, more intense experience. It can be invigorating, sometimes even shocking, like a waltz with a stranger you will never see again, or a kiss in the dark, or a beautiful curio for sale laid out on a cheap blanket at a street bazaar. And, yes, when my stories are collected, I always feel like a street vendor, one who sells only at midnight.

Roald Dahl’s much-loved brown and white Jack Russell terrier Chopper, who was very naughty, was the last dog he owned. Chopper was fed on a diet of oysters, caviar Smarties, and the occasional can of dog food. He used to accompany Roald everywhere—they even appeared on TV together—and he always seemed to know what Roald was saying. Roald was planning a story about a girl and a dog who understood each other’s language when he died. Only three members of Roald’s family ever appeared in

Abelman’s Dry Goods     Kansas City, Missouri     U. S. A.          Mr. I. Abelman, Mongoloid, Esq.:     We have received via post your absurd comments about our trousers, the comments revealing, as they did, your total lack of contact with reality. Were you more aware, you would know or realize by now that the offending trousers were dispatched to you with our full knowledge that they were inadequate so far as length was concerned.     “Why? Why?” you are in your incomprehensible babble, unable to assimilate stimulating concepts of commerce into your retarded and blighted worldview.     The trousers were sent to you (1) as a means of testing your initiative (A clever, wide-awake business concern should be able to make three-quarter length trousers a by-word of masculine fashion. Your advertising and merchandising programs are obviously faulty.) and (2) as a means of testing your ability to meet the standards requisite in a distributor of our quality product. (Our loyal and dependable outlets can vend any trouser bearing the Levy label no matter how abominable their design and construction. You are apparently a faithless people.)     We do not wish to be bothered in the future by such tedious complaints. Please confine your correspondence to orders only. We are a busy and dynamic organization whose mission needless effrontery and harassment can only hinder. If you molest us again, sir, you may feel the sting of the lash across your pitiful shoulders.     Yours in anger,     Gus Levy, Pres.

The oldest Egyptian or Hindoo philosopher raised a corner of the veil from the statue of the divinity; and still the trembling robe remains raised, and I gaze upon as fresh a glory as he did, since it was I in him that was then so bold, and it is he in me that now reviews the vision. No dust has settled on that robe; no time has elapsed since that divinity was revealed. That time which we really improve, or which is improvable, is neither past, present, nor future.

Full Moon and Eclipse of the Sun * On Horses Dying in the Stables Is it possible, finally, for one human being to achieve perfect understanding of another? We can invest enormous time and energy in serious efforts to know another person, but in the end, how close are we able to come to that persons essence? We convince ourselves that we know the other person well, but do we really know anything important about anyone?

Last week I wrote a story, and all the time I was writing it I thought it was a good story; but when it was finished and I had read it through, I found that there was something missing, that it didn’t ring true. So I tore it up. I wrote a poem, about an old man sleeping in the sun, and this was true, but it was finished quickly, and once again I was left with the problem of what to write next. And I remembered my father, who taught me to write; and I thought, why not write about my father, and about the trees we planted, and about the people I knew while growing up and about what happened on the way to growing up. . . .

"Because playing Schubert's piano sonatas well is one of the hardest things in the world. Especially this, the Sonata in D Major. It's a tough piece to master. Some pianists can play one or maybe two of the movements perfectly, but if you listen to all four movements as a unified whole, no one has ever nailed it. A lot of famous pianists have tried to rise to the challenge, but it's like there's always something missing. There's never one where you can say, Yes! He's got it! Do you know why?" "No," I reply. "Because the sonata itself is imperfect. Robert Schumann understood Schubert's sonatas well,

Having no music doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would. There're lots of other sounds that take its place—the chirping of birds, the cries of all sorts of insects, the gurgle of the brook, the rustling of leaves. Rain falls, something scrambles across the cabin roof, and sometimes I hear indescribable sounds I can't explain. I never knew the world was full of so many beautiful, natural sounds. I've ignored them my entire life, but not now. I sit on the porch for hours with my eyes closed, trying to be inconspicuous, picking up each and every sound around me.

"Kind of an ominous prophecy." "Like Cassandra." "Cassandra?" I ask. "The Greek tragedy. Cassandra was the princess of Troy who prophesied. She was a temple priestess, and Apollo gave her the power to predict fate. In return he tried to force her to sleep with him, but she refused and he put a curse on her. Greek gods are more mythological than religious figures. By that I mean they have the same character flaws humans do. They fly off the handle, get horny, jealous, forgetful. You name it." He takes a small box of lemon drops out of the glove compartment and pops one in his mouth. He motions for me to take one, and I do. "What kind of curse was it?" "The curse on Cassandra?" I nod. "The curse Apollo laid on her was that all her prophecies would be true, but nobody would ever believe them. On top of that, her prophecies would all be unlucky ones—predictions of betrayals, accidents, deaths, the country falling into ruin. That sort of thing. People not only didn't believe her, they began to despise her. If you haven't read them yet, I really recommend the plays by Euripides or Aeschylus. They show a lot of the essential problems we struggle with even today. In koros." "Koros? What's that?" "That's what they called the chorus they used in Greek plays. It stands at the back of the stage and explains in unison the situation or what the characters are feeling deep down inside. Sometimes they even try to influence the characters. It's a very convenient device. Sometimes I wish I had my own chorus standing behind me." "Are you able to prophesy?" "No such luck." He smiles. "For

Features So here we are. iOS 7-land with TextKit. Let’s see what it can do! Before we dive into it I still want to mention that, strictly speaking, most of these things were possible before. If you had plenty of resources and time to build a text engine on top of CoreText, these were all doable. But if you wanted to build a fully fledged rich text editor before, this could mean months of work. Now it’s as easy as opening an interface file in Xcode and dropping a UITextView into your view controller to get all these features: Kerning: Drop the idea that all characters have simple quadratic shapes and that these shapes must be placed exactly adjacent to each other. Modern text layout takes into account that, for example, a capital letter “T” does have a lot of free space under its “wings” and moves the following lowercase letters closer. This results in significantly improved legibility of text, especially in longer pieces of writing. Ligatures: I consider this mostly an artistic feature, but some texts do look nicer (more artistic) when certain character combinations (like an “f” followed by an “l”) are drawn using combined symbols (so-called glyphs). Image Attachments: It is now possible to have images inside a text view. Hyphenation: Not so important for editing text, but for presenting text in a nice and readable way. Hyphenation means splitting longer words at line boundaries, creating a more homogeneous flow and look of the overall text. Anecdote: Before iOS 7, developers had to employ CoreText directly. Like so: Start by detecting the text language on a per-sentence basis, then get the possible hyphenation point for each word in the sentence, then insert a custom hyphenation placeholder character at each suggested point. After preparation is done, run CoreText’s layout and manually insert a hyphen into wrapped lines. If you want great results, check afterward if the text with the hyphen still fits into the line’s boundaries and if it doesn’t, re-run the lines’s layout without the previously used hyphenation point. With TextKit, enabling hyphenation is as easy as setting the hyphenationFactor property.

String: Where there is text to be drawn, there must somewhere be a string to hold it. In the default configuration, the string is contained within and managed by the NSTextStorage, and in these cases, it may be left out from the drawing. But that need not necessarily be the case. With TextKit, the text can originate from whatever source suits the use case. For a code editor, for example, the string could actually be an annotated syntax tree (AST) that contains all information about the structure of the displayed code. With a custom-built text storage, this text is then only later and dynamically enriched with text attributes like font or color highlights. For the first time, developers are able to directly use their own model for a text component. All that is needed is a specially engineered text storage. Which leads us to:

NSLayoutManager: The layout manager is the central component that brings it all together: The manager listens to text or attribute change notifications in the text storage and, upon reception, triggers the layout process. Starting with the text provided by the text storage, it translates all characters into glyphs2. Once the glyphs have been generated, the manager consults its text container(s) for the available regions for text. These regions are then filled stepwise with lines, which again are filled stepwise with glyphs. Once a line has been filled, the next one is started. For each line, the layout manager must consider line-breaking behavior (the word not fitting must be moved to the next line), hyphenation, inline image attachments, and so forth. When layout is finished, the text view’s current display state is invalidated and the layout manager draws the previously set text into the text view.

"If you play Schubert's sonatas, especially this one straight through, it's not art. Like Schumann pointed out, it's too long and too pastoral, and technically too simplistic. Play it through the way it is and it's flat and tasteless, some dusty antique. Which is why every pianist who attempts it adds something of his own, something extra. Like this—hear how he articulates it there? Adding rubato. Adjusting the pace, modulation, whatever. Otherwise they can't hold it all together. They have to be careful, though, or else all those extra devices destroy the dignity of the piece. Then it's not Schubert's music anymore. Every single pianist who's played this sonata struggles with the same paradox."

On the other hand there are scenarios like importing data, where the context on the main thread is not interested in any or only a small fraction of the new data. In this case a nested context setup (especially one where the data has to flow through the main thread context) is the wrong tool for the job and results in massive amounts of work done for nothing.

The intent of parentContext is to improve the atomaticity of changes. parentContext allows changes to be batch up and committed en masse.

When a change is made in a context, but not saved, it is visible to all of its’ descendants but not to its’ ancestors. When a context is saved the changes are pushed up to its’ direct ancestor, i.e. the value of its’ .parentContext property. But for the changes to persist further up the ancestor chain a save must be repeated on each parent context. When a save is performed on a root context, i.e. a context without a parent context, it is pushed to the persistent store (via the persistent store coordinator) and becomes visible to all contexts connected to the store.

Each context maintains its own cache. When a child context performs a fetch it will receive the result from the cache of closest ancestor that contains the data or the persistent store if none of the ancestors contain the required data. This behaviour can prevent changes made in an ancestor context being visible to a descendant.

Consider the following scenario context hierarchy: persistentStoreCoordinator -> rootContext -> mainContext -> childContext mainContext fetches objectA rootContext fetches objectA rootContext updates objectA childContext fetches objectA In this example childContext will not see the updated value in rootContext, it will see the value in mainContext which, depending on the semantics of the data model, may be incorrect.

The child contexts’ merge policy is ignored parentContext doesn’t use the existing merge functionality, NSMergePolicy, for handling saves from a child context. When a child context is saved the changes will always overwrite the parents’ data.

There’s an edge case which is worth noting: If a child context is saved but the values do not differ from the cached values then the save is ignored. This only becomes an issue when changes from the parent are not merged into children.

Prior to the introduction of the new concurrency model concurrency was only supported by use of the confinement pattern. The confinement pattern dictates that all messages sent to a context must be sent on the thread that the context was created on.

awakeFromInsert is called when an object is first created, as such you’d expect this method only ever be called once. And that’s exactly what the documentation says: This method is invoked only once in the object’s lifetime. But that’s not true. When an inserted object propagates up to a parent context (due to the child being saved) awakeFromInsert is called again in the parent context. awakeFromInsert is called as part of the save; the object doesn’t need to be explicitly accessed in the parent context. When an awakeFromInsert is called in a parent context the object is ’empty’, it does not yet contain the values from the child context. If we only inspect the object it is impossible to tell if it has been genuinely inserted or if it’s propagating from a child context.

But even as I yearn for it, I fear it. Because the more I see of this cruel world, the less I believe it ends in some pleasant fiction.

The ceiling parts. Light burns my eyes. I clamp them shut as the floor of my cell rises upward till, with a click, it stops and I rest, exposed, on a flat stone surface. I push out my legs and gasp, nearly fainting from the pain. Joints crack. Knotted tendons unspool. I fight to reopen my eyes against the raging light. Tears fill them. It is so bright I can only catch bleached flashes of the world around.

MY ROOM IN Shahganj was very small. I had paced about in it so often that I knew its exact measurements: twelve feet by ten. The string of my cot needed tightening. The dip in the middle was so pronounced that I invariably woke up in the morning with a backache; but I was hopeless at tightening charpoy strings. Under the cot was my tin trunk. Its contents ranged from old, rejected manuscripts to clothes and letters and photographs. I had resolved that one day, when I had made some money with a book, I would throw the trunk and everything else out of the window, and leave Shahganj forever. But until then I was a prisoner.

You don’t need to import a separate library for functionality like input/output or string handling. Code written at global scope is used as the entry point for the program, so you don’t need a main() function. You also don’t need to write semicolons at the end of every statement.

constant or variable must have the same type as the value you want to assign to it. However, you don’t always have to write the type explicitly. Providing a value when you create a constant or variable lets the compiler infer its type.

There are two-toed sloths and there are three-toed sloths, the case being determined by the forepaws of the animals, since all sloths have three claws on their hind paws. I had the great luck one summer of studying the three-toed sloth in situ in the equatorial jungles of Brazil. It is a highly intriguing creature. Its only real habit is indolence. It sleeps or rests on average twenty hours a day. Our team tested the sleep habits of five wild three-toed sloths by placing on their heads, in the early evening after they had fallen asleep, bright red plastic dishes filled with water. We found them still in place late the next morning, the water of the dishes swarming with

THE BOY with fair hair lowered himself down the last few feet of rock and began to pick his way toward the lagoon. Though he had taken off his school sweater and trailed it now from one hand, his grey shirt stuck to him and his hair was plastered to his forehead. All round him the long scar smashed into the jungle was a bath of heat. He was clambering heavily among the creepers and broken trunks when a bird, a vision of red and yellow, flashed upwards with a witch-like cry; and this cry was echoed by another.

The voice spoke again. “I can’t hardly move with all these creeper things.” The owner of the voice came backing out of the undergrowth so that twigs scratched on a greasy wind-breaker. The naked crooks of his knees were plump, caught and scratched by thorns. He bent down, removed the thorns carefully, and turned around. He was shorter than the fair boy and very fat. He came forward, searching out safe lodgments for his feet, and then looked up through thick spectacles. “Where’s the man with the megaphone?”

The fair boy began to pick his way as casually as possible toward the water. He tried to be offhand and not too obviously uninterested, but the fat boy hurried after him. “Aren’t there any grownups at all?” “I don’t think so.” The fair boy said this solemnly; but then the delight of a realized ambition overcame him. In the middle of the scar he stood on his head and grinned at the reversed fat boy. “No grownups!” The fat boy thought for a moment. “That pilot.” The fair boy allowed his feet to come down and sat on the steamy earth. “He must have flown off after he dropped us. He couldn’t land here. Not in a plane with wheels.” “We was attacked!” “He’ll be back all right.” The fat boy shook his head.

A large drop of water hit the windowsill, darkening the thick dust on the woodwork. A faint breeze had sprung up, and again I felt the moisture, closer and warmer. Then the rain approached like a dark curtain. I could see it marching down the street, heavy and remorseless. It drummed on the corrugated tin roof and swept across the road and over the balcony of my room. I sat there without moving, letting the rain soak my sticky shirt and gritty hair.

In hot upcountry towns in India it is good to have the first monsoon showers arrive at night, while you are sleeping on the veranda. You wake up to the scent of wet earth and fallen neem leaves, and find that a hot and stuffy bungalow has been converted into a cool, damp place. The swish of the banana fronds and the drumming of the rain on broad-leaved sal trees will soothe the most fevered brow.

when Prem closed my window to keep out these winged visitors, I remonstrated, saying that as a nature lover I would share my room with them. I’d forgotten that I am inclined to sleep with my mouth open. In the wee hours I woke up, spluttering and choking, to find that I had almost swallowed a large and somewhat unpleasant-tasting moth. I closed the window. Moths are lovely creatures, but a good night’s sleep is even lovelier.

The Raven was the first of the few poems which he nearly brought to completion before printing. It may be that those who care for poetry lost little by his death. Fluent in prose, he never wrote verse for the sake of making a poem. When a refrain of image haunted him, the lyric that resulted was the inspiration, as he himself said, of a passion, not of a purpose.

The components of The Raven are few and simple: a man, a bird, and the phantasmal memory at a woman. But the piece affords a fine display of romantic material. What have we? The midnight; the shadowy chamber with its tomes of forgotten lore; the student,—a modern Hieronymus; the raven's tap on the casement; the wintry night and dying fire; the silken wind-swept hangings; the dreams and vague mistrust of the echoing darkness; the black, uncanny bird upon the pallid bust; the accessories of violet velvet and the gloating lamp. All this stage effect of situation, light, color, sound, is purely romantic, and even melodramatic, but of a poetic quality that melodrama rarely exhibits, and thoroughly reflective of the poet's "eternal passion, eternal pain."

My belief is that the first conception and rough draft of this poem came as inspiration always comes; that its author then saw how it might be perfected, giving it the final touches described in his chapter on Composition, and that the latter, therefore, is neither wholly false nor wholly true. The harm of such analysis is that it tempts a novice to fancy that artificial processes can supersede imagination. The impulse of genius is to guard the secrets of its creative hour.

Public access enables entities to be used within any source file from their defining module, and also in a source file from another module that imports the defining module. You typically use public access when specifying the public interface to a framework. Internal access enables entities to be used within any source file from their defining module, but not in any source file outside of that module. You typically use internal access when defining an app’s or a framework’s internal structure. Private access restricts the use of an entity to its own defining source file. Use private access to hide the implementation details of a specific piece of functionality.

Because types can conform to more than one protocol, they can be decorated with default behaviors from multiple protocols. Unlike multiple inheritance of classes which some programming languages support, protocol extensions do not introduce any additional state. Protocols can be adopted by classes, structs and enums. Base classes and inheritance are restricted to class types.

Cannot call protocol extension members from Objective-C. Cannot use the where clause with a struct type. Cannot define multiple comma-separated where clauses, similar to an if let statement. Cannot store dynamic variables inside a protocol extension. This is also true for non-generic extensions. Static variables are supposed to be allowed, but as of Xcode 7.0 they print the error “static stored properties not yet supported in generic types.” Cannot call super to invoke a protocol extension, unlike a non-generic extension. @ketzusaka pointed out that this is possible by calling (self as MyProtocol).method(). Nice catch! For this reason there’s no real concept of protocol extension inheritance. Cannot adopt multiple protocol extensions with duplicate members. The Swift runtime chooses the last protocol adopted and ignores the others. For example, if we have 2 protocol extensions which implement the same methods, only the last one we’ve adopted will be used when the method is invoked. There’s no way to invoke the methods from the other extensions. Cannot extend optional protocol methods. Optional protocol methods require the @objc tag, which cannot be used together with a protocol extension. Cannot declare a protocol & its extension at the same time. It would be nice to be able to declare extension protocol SomeProtocol {} to simultaneously declare the protocol and implement the extension, since protocols don’t always have any members when the extension contains all of the important logic.

Swift provides a solution to these sorts of issues in the form of Optional values. Optionals are a state machine that either represents a value, or nothing. This is fundamentally different from the concept of nil in Objective-C where it is just another location in memory, albeit an often invalid location.

The bang operator, ! is used to “unwrap” an Optional value. That is, if the Optional represents a value, then it will return the value. If the Optional value represents the absense of a value, doing so will throw an exception. It’s important to always make sure an optional value is not nil before attempting to unwrap it. It is generally preferable to favor the conditional let syntax described above.

Optionals can also be chained using the ? operator. For example, the UIViewController property presentedViewController is of type UIViewController?. We can access its properties using optional chaining; the properties are automatically wrapped in an optional themselves in the process. If we were to access the view property of the presentedViewController without optional chaining, first we need to get a valid reference to the view controller itself, if it exists. Then if it does, we can access its view. With optional chaining, we can combine these into one step. However, notice the view types are different. In this case it returns a UIView wrapped in an optional.

THERE IS LESS crime in the hills than in the plains, and so the few murders that do take place from time to time stand out as landmarks in the annals of a hill station. Among the gravestones in the Mussoorie cemetery there is one which bears the inscription: ‘Murdered by the hand he befriended.’ This is the grave of Mr James Reginald Clapp, a chemist’s assistant, who was brutally done to death on the night of 31 August 1909.

I do not kill insects and other small creatures if I can help it, but there is a limit to my hospitality. I spared a centipede yesterday even though, last year, I was bitten by one which had occupied the seat of my pyjamas. Our hill scorpions and centipedes are not as dangerous as those found in the plains, and probably the same can be said for the people.

I think his longevity is due simply to the fact that he refuses to go to bed when he is unwell. No amount of diarrhoea, or water in his lungs, will prevent him from getting up, dressing, writing letters, or getting on with the latest Wodehouse (a contemporary of his) or Blackwood’s Magazine, to which he has been subscribing for the last fifty years! He was pleased to find that some of my own essays were appearing in Blackwood’s. Nothing will keep him from his four o’clock tea or his evening whisky-and-soda. He is determined, I am sure, to die in his chair, with all his clothes on. The thought of being taken unawares while still in his pyjamas must be something of a nightmare to him.

But we are equipped with legs for the purpose of walking. As more and more people grow dependent on their cars, a new species of humans will evolve.

The first day of monsoon mist. And it’s strange how all the birds fall silent as the mist comes climbing up the hill. Perhaps that’s what makes the mist so melancholy; not only does it conceal the hills, it blankets them in silence too. Only an hour ago the trees were ringing with birdsong. And now the forest is deathly still, as though it were midnight.

Every reference to an object in Objective-C is a pointer, which means that it can be nil. That means, that every interaction with an Objective-C API from Swift must use an optional where there is a reference to an object.

This should be extremely rare, but if your app could literally not continue to run if a variable is nil when accessed, it would be a waste of time to bother testing it for nil. Normally if you have a condition that must absolutely be true for your app to continue running, you would use an assert. An Implicitly Unwrapped Optional has an assert for nil built right into it.

So intent was Frank upon solving the puzzle of Lemarchand's box that he didn't hear the great bell begin to ring. The device had been constructed by a master craftsman, and the riddle was this-that though he'd been told the box contained wonders, there simply seemed to be no way into it, no clue on any of its six black lacquered faces as to the whereabouts of the pressure points that would disengage one piece of this three-dimensional jigsaw from another.       Frank had seen similar puzzles-mostly in Hong Kong, products of the Chinese taste for making metaphysics of hard wood-but to the acuity and technical genius of the Chinese the Frenchman had brought a perverse logic that was entirely his own. If there was a system to the puzzle, Frank had failed to find it. Only after several hours of trial and error did a chance juxtaposition of thumbs, middle and last fingers bear fruit: an almost imperceptible click, and then-victory!-a segment of the box slid out from beside its neighbors.

There was no church in the city-however desperate for adherents-that would ring a summoning bell at such an hour.

So, the Swift compiler isn’t cool with you treating an ArraySlice as an Array, but that’s because it wants you to be more clear about your intentions. Since sum is doing SequenceType things, it should accept a SequenceType argument.       func sum<T: SequenceType where T.Generator.Element == Int>(list: T) -> Int {    return list.reduce(0, combine: { (acc, e) in        return acc + e    })}     The sum method can now accept both Array and ArraySlice — or any other SequenceType whose elements are Int. Not only does this work (that part is good), but it is a more explicit and accurate representation of our intentions for sum. In other words, Objective-C is a relationship built on lies. Both of you are happy to call things NSArray, but deep down you both know things aren’t NSArray. Swift doesn’t put up with that nonsense.

Debugging with Assertions An assertion is a runtime check that a Boolean condition definitely evaluates to true. Literally put, an assertion “asserts” that a condition is true. You use an assertion to make sure that an essential condition is satisfied before executing any further code. If the condition evaluates to true, code execution continues as usual; if the condition evaluates to false, code execution ends, and your app is terminated. If your code triggers an assertion while running in a debug environment, such as when you build and run an app in Xcode, you can see exactly where the invalid state occurred and query the state of your app at the time that the assertion was triggered. An assertion also lets you provide a suitable debug message as to the nature of the assert. You write an assertion by calling the Swift standard library global assert(_:_:file:line:) function. You pass this function an expression that evaluates to true or false and a message that should be displayed if the result of the condition is false: let age = -3 assert(age >= 0, "A person's age cannot be less than zero") // this causes the assertion to trigger, because age is not >= 0 In this example, code execution will continue only if age >= 0 evaluates to true, that is, if the value of age is non-negative. If the value of age is negative, as in the code above, then age >= 0 evaluates to false, and the assertion is triggered, terminating the application.

you define a protocol instance method requirement that is intended to mutate instances of any type that adopts the protocol, mark the method with the mutating keyword as part of the protocol’s definition. This enables structures and enumerations to adopt the protocol and satisfy that method requirement. Note If you mark a protocol instance method requirement as mutating, you do not need to write the mutating keyword when writing an implementation of that method for a class. The mutating keyword is only used by structures and enumerations.

You can limit protocol adoption to class types (and not structures or enumerations) by adding the class keyword to a protocol’s inheritance list. The class keyword must always appear first in a protocol’s inheritance list, before any inherited protocols: protocol SomeClassOnlyProtocol: class, SomeInheritedProtocol { // class-only protocol definition goes here } In the example above, SomeClassOnlyProtocol can only be adopted by class types. It is a compile-time error to write a structure or enumeration definition that tries to adopt SomeClassOnlyProtocol. Note Use a class-only protocol when the behavior defined by that protocol’s requirements assumes or requires that a conforming type has reference semantics rather than value semantics. For more on reference and value semantics, see Structures and Enumerations Are Value Types and Classes Are Reference Types.

func swapTwoInts(inout a: Int, inout _ b: Int) func swapTwoValues<T>(inout a: T, inout _ b: T) The generic version of the function uses a placeholder type name (called T, in this case) instead of an actual type name (such as Int, String, or Double). The placeholder type name doesn’t say anything about what T must be, but it does say that both a and b must be of the same type T, whatever T represents. The actual type to use in place of T will be determined each time the swapTwoValues(_:_:) function is called. The other difference is that the generic function’s name (swapTwoValues(_:_:)) is followed by the placeholder type name (T) inside angle brackets (<T>). The brackets tell Swift that T is a placeholder type name within the swapTwoValues(_:_:) function definition. Because T is a placeholder, Swift does not look for an actual type called

Not every type in Swift can be compared with the equal to operator (==). If you create your own class or structure to represent a complex data model, for example, then the meaning of “equal to” for that class or structure is not something that Swift can guess for you. Because of this, it is not possible to guarantee that this code will work for every possible type T, and an appropriate error is reported when you try to compile the code.

Thanks to Swift’s type inference, you don’t actually need to declare a concrete ItemType of Int as part of the definition of IntStack. Because IntStack conforms to all of the requirements of the Container protocol, Swift can infer the appropriate ItemType to use, simply by looking at the type of the append(_:) method’s item parameter and the return type of the subscript. Indeed, if you delete the typealias ItemType = Int line from the code above, everything still works, because it is clear what

Parameterized protocols can also introduce an ambiguity problem: What happens if a type adopts SomeProtocol<String> and SomeProtocol<UITableViewCell>? C# solves this by requiring all but one of the protocols to be explicit and essentially hidden. You have to cast the object to the protocol to access the alternate implementation. In Swift it might look like func remove() implements SomeProtocol<UITableViewCell> { ... } which would only be callable if you cast the object to SomeProtocol<UITableViewCell>, while the SomeProtocol<String> implementation would be the default visible version. Notice that the type parameter doesn’t appear in the function signature and imagine the confusion that ensues as the wrong version of remove() gets called.

Swift provides a default initializer for any structure or class that provides default values for all of its properties and does not provide at least one initializer itself. The default initializer simply creates a new instance with all of its properties set to their default values. This example defines a class called ShoppingListItem, which encapsulates the name, quantity, and purchase state of an item in a shopping list: class ShoppingListItem { var name: String? var quantity = 1 var purchased = false } var item = ShoppingListItem() Because all properties of the ShoppingListItem class have default values, and because it is a base class with no superclass, ShoppingListItem automatically gains a default initializer implementation that creates a new instance with all of its properties set to their default values. (The name property is an optional String property, and so it automatically receives a default value of nil, even though this value is not written in the code.) The example above uses the default initializer for the ShoppingListItem class to create a new instance of the class with initializer syntax, written as ShoppingListItem(), and assigns this new instance to a variable called

Memberwise Initializers for Structure Types Structure types automatically receive a memberwise initializer if they do not define any of their own custom initializers. Unlike a default initializer, the structure receives a memberwise initializer even if it has stored properties that do not have default values. The memberwise initializer is a shorthand way to initialize the member properties of new structure instances. Initial values for the properties of the new instance can be passed to the memberwise initializer by name. The example below defines a structure called Size with two properties called width and height. Both properties are inferred to be of type Double by assigning a default value of 0.0. The Size structure automatically receives an init(width:height:) memberwise initializer, which you can use to initialize a new Size instance: struct Size { var width = 0.0, height = 0.0 } let twoByTwo = Size(width: 2.0, height: 2.0)

As mentioned above, different characters can require different amounts of memory to store, so in order to determine which Character is at a particular position, you must iterate over each Unicode scalar from the start or end of that String. For this reason, Swift strings cannot be indexed by integer values. Use the startIndex property to access the position of the first Character of a String. The endIndex property is the position after the last character in a String. As a result, the endIndex property isn’t a valid argument to a string’s subscript. If a String is empty, startIndex and endIndex are equal.

you need the integer index of each item as well as its value, use the enumerated() method to iterate over the array instead. For each item in the array, the enumerated() method returns a tuple composed of the index and the value for that item. You can decompose the tuple into temporary constants or variables as part of the iteration: for (index, value) in shoppingList.enumerated() { print("Item \(index + 1): \(value)") }

Default Parameter Values You can define a default value for any parameter in a function by assigning a value to the parameter after that parameter’s type. If a default value is defined, you can omit that parameter when calling the function. func someFunction(parameterWithDefault: Int = 12) { // In the function body, if no arguments are passed to the function // call, the value of parameterWithDefault is 12. } someFunction(parameterWithDefault: 6) // parameterWithDefault is 6 someFunction() // parameterWithDefault is 12 Note Place parameters with default values at the end of a function’s parameter list. This ensures that all calls to the function use the same order for their nondefault arguments, and makes it clear that the same function is being called in each case.

UIStoryboard: Safer with Enums, Protocol Extensions and Generics — Swift Programming (medium.com)

extension StoryboardIdentifiable where Self: UIViewController {static var storyboardIdentifier: String {return String(self)}} In our protocol extension declaration, there is a where clause which makes it only apply to classes that are either UIViewController or it’s subclasses. This will stop other classes such as NSDate from getting a storyboardIdentifier protocol variable. Inside the protocol extension, we’re providing a method to get the storyboardIdentifier string dynamically from the class at runtime. I’d only just recently found out about this Swift String functionality thanks to NatashaTheRobot’s blog post. It’s a much better than it’s Objective-C counterpart, NSStringFromClass() for obvious reasons.

 func reverseZip<T,U>(xs: [T], _ ys: [U]) -> AnySequence<(T,U)> {    return AnySequence(zip(xs, ys).reverse())}           Now we can keep our implementation details private. If we have some internal sequence type, we don’t have to share it with our callers. We just give them what they need and no more. Notice that AnySequence is not a protocol. It’s a generic struct that wraps another sequence. You can’t use an [Int] in a place that expects an AnySequence<Int>.

These “Any” type erasers also aren’t like Any and AnyObject, which are protocols that just “hide” the type. You can still as! an AnyObject back to its original type. AnySequence and its kin completely encapsulate the underlying data. You can’t get the original back. This creates a very strong abstraction layer and strengthens type safety by making as! casting impossible.

Extended grapheme clusters can be composed of one or more Unicode scalars. This means that different characters—and different representations of the same character—can require different amounts of memory to store. Because of this, characters in Swift do not each take up the same amount of memory within a string’s representation. As a result, the number of characters in a string cannot be calculated without iterating through the string to determine its extended grapheme cluster boundaries. If you are working with particularly long string values, be aware that the characters property must iterate over the Unicode scalars in the entire string in order to determine the characters for that string. The count of the characters returned by the characters property is not always the same as the length property of an NSString that contains the same characters. The length of an NSString is based on the number of 16-bit code units within the string’s UTF-16 representation and not the number of Unicode extended grapheme clusters within the string.

optional ?? defaultValue In this example, we really do not want to evaluate defaultValue if the optional variable is non-nil — it could be a very expensive computation that we only want to run if it is absolutely necessary. We can resolve this issue as follows: func ??<T>(optional: T?, defaultValue: () -> T) -> T { if let x = optional { return x } else { return defaultValue() } } Instead of providing a default value of type T, we now provide one of type () -> T. The code in the defaultValue closure is now only executed when we pass it its (void) argument. In this definition, this code is only executed in the else branch, as we intended. The only drawback is that when calling the ?? operator, we need to create an explicit closure for the default value. For example, we would need to write: myOptional ?? { myDefaultValue } The definition in the Swift standard library avoids the need for creating explicit closures by using Swift’s autoclosure type attribute. This implicitly wraps any arguments to the ?? operator in the required closure. As a result, we can provide the same interface that we initially had, but without requiring the user to create an explicit closure wrapping the defaultValue argument. The actual definition used in Swift’s standard library is as follows: infix operator ?? { associativity right precedence 110 } func ??<T>(optional: T?, @autoclosure defaultValue: () -> T) -> T {

Similarly, we can redefine the ?? operator to work on our Result type. Note that, instead of taking an autoclosure argument, we expect a function that handles the NSError to produce the desired value of type T: func ??<T>(result: Result<T>, handleError: NSError -> T) -> T { switch result { case let Result.Success(box):

Tyrion Lannister.” Tyrion sighed. “You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?” “Fourteen,” the boy said. “Fourteen, and you’re taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slaver’s grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years.

I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldn’t you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind … and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge.” Tyrion tapped the leather cover

An essay is built around a particular mood in the mind of the writer. ‘Give the mood, and the essay, from the first sentence to the last, grows around it as the cocoon grows around the silkworm.’ (Alexander Smith, 1863) What is the difference between an essay and a short story? It depends, I suppose, upon whose personality comes through more strongly, the author’s or the characters he describes. If it is the author’s, then it is really an essay. If it is the characters, then it is a story.
